About 2-3 Tree
-------------
"2–3 tree is a tree data structure, where every node with children (internal node) has either two children (2-node) and one data element or three children (3-nodes) and two data elements. According to Knuth, "a B-tree of order 3 is a 2-3 tree." Nodes on the outside of the tree (leaf nodes) have no children and one or two data elements. 2−3 trees were invented by John Hopcroft in 1970."  (See more details on [<i class="icon-wikipedia"></i> Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2–3_tree)).
